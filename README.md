## Fungible

> This fork of [Fungible](https://github.com/magistermaks/mod-fungible) adds support for versions above 1.20

This mod, with help of some mixin hacks, speeds up game and world loading
times by selectively bricking parts of the game. Do not use outside the
development environment - it will cause world corruption when upgrading 
save data. With this mod it takes about 8s to launch the game and load into
a world, compared to the average 19s to do the same on vanilla. It also silences 
the annoying auth exception that takes focus away from the game log in IDEA.
